        <p>Getting started</p>
        <ol>
            <li id="req">Keeping track of your cash flows
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are employed by a registered employer, you can get either a W-2 or a W-4 form from them</li> 
                    <li>Alternatively, if you are self employed or have income not from a job, use a 1099 form</li>
                    <li>When doing this, make sure that you have a good account of all the money you have earned and have good records</li>
                </ul>
            </li> <br><br>
            <li id="st1">Reporting Cash flows
                <ul>
                    <li>Option 1 is to claim that the money is gift from uncle</li> 
                    <li>Alternatively, create a shell business and pay yourself as an equity dividend, not as a wage so you avoid self employment tax</li>
                    <li>If you want to avoid taxes, try to maximize payments in cash, and only report the cash flows into your back account to the IRS</li> 
                    <li>This way, you don't get taxed on your cash earnings since they aren't traceable</li>
                    <li>to legally reduce taxes, make sure you deduct interest expenses and depreciation from earnings first, you get a tax break</li>
                </ul>
            </li> <br><br>
            <li id="st2" class="funkytown">Making sure you don't get caught (very important)
                <ul>
                    <li>If you use the method of not reporting cash, don't make the mistake of depositing it all into your bank account after in large sums</li>
                    <li>This will alert the IRS that you have unreported income, and looks very suspicious</li>
                    <li>If you suspect that the IRS is after you, move your money into a swiss bank account</li>
                    <li>You can also consider moving to Lithuania or Thailand where the IRS will have less direct influence</li>
                    <li>May need to take alternative transportation such as a boat or private plane, as you could get caught at the airport unless you have fake id</li>
                    <li>In extreme cases, it may be favorable to first fake your death to keep them off of your tail</li>
                </ul>
